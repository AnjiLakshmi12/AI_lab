Got it, Anji 🌟
Let’s explain this **Truth Table Entailment Algorithm** from your image **in the simplest way possible** — step by step, like a story 👇

---

## 🧩 What the Algorithm Does

This algorithm checks if a **Knowledge Base (KB)** **logically entails** (guarantees) a **query (α)** —
that is, if **α is true every time KB is true.**

---

## 💡 Step-by-Step Simple Explanation

### 🧠 Function 1: `TT-ENTAILS?(KB, α)`

**Meaning:**
This is the *main function* that starts the process.

**What it does:**

1. It takes the **knowledge base (KB)** and the **query (α)** as input.
2. It collects all **symbols** (like P, Q, R) used in KB and α.
3. It calls another function `TT-CHECK-ALL` to check all truth combinations for those symbols.

So basically it says:

> “Let’s test all possible truth values for P, Q, and R to see if the KB always makes α true.”

---

### ⚙️ Function 2: `TT-CHECK-ALL(KB, α, symbols, model)`

**Meaning:**
This function checks *every possible truth combination* (like a truth table).

---

### Step 1️⃣ — Base Case

```text
if EMPTY?(symbols)
```

This means:

> “If there are no more symbols left to assign truth values, check if the KB is true in this situation.”

---

### Step 2️⃣ — When KB is True

```text
if PL-TRUE?(KB, model)
    then return PL-TRUE?(α, model)
```

If the KB is **true** in this row,
→ check if the **query (α)** is also true.
If yes → good (continue).
If not → entailment fails.

---

### Step 3️⃣ — When KB is False

```text
else return true
```

If KB is **false**, that model doesn’t matter (because entailment only cares when KB is true).
So it just says “true” and moves on.

---

### Step 4️⃣ — Recursive Step

```text
else do
    P = FIRST(symbols)
    rest = REST(symbols)
```

Here, it picks the **first symbol (P)** and then divides the rest of the symbols.

Then it tries **both possibilities**:

* One time assuming P = true
* One time assuming P = false

It keeps doing this until all possible combinations have been checked.

---

### Step 5️⃣ — Return Final Result

```text
return (TT-CHECK-ALL(... {P=true})) 
    and (TT-CHECK-ALL(... {P=false}))
```

It combines both results.
If **both cases** are true (meaning α was true in all cases where KB was true),
then overall result = **True** (KB entails α).
Otherwise = **False**.

## 🧾 Simple Summary

| Step | What It Means                          | Example             |
| ---- | -------------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| 1    | Start with all symbols                 | P, Q, R             |
| 2    | Assign truth values (make truth table) | Try every T/F combo |
| 3    | If KB is true, check if α is true too  | If yes → continue   |
| 4    | If α is false when KB is true          | Entailment fails    |
| 5    | If α true in all KB-true cases         | KB entails α ✅      |

---

## 💬 In Plain English

> The algorithm checks all possible truth combinations (like rows in a truth table).
> If every time the **KB** is true, the **query (α)** is also true,
> then we can say **the KB entails α**.
> Otherwise, it doesn’t.

Would you like me to explain this **same algorithm using a small real-life example** (like Riya and the library one)? That will make it even easier to visualize.
